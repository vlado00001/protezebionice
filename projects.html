    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The 3-D modelling starts with a concept, a simple idea of what you want to do. In our case, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis" target="_blank">prothesis</a> is something more complex just because the measurements vary from person to person.</p>

    <p>The general mechanical part:
    We think it's useless and boring to <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/elaborate" target="_blank">elaborate</a> every aspect of it, but these are the main points that are worth mentioning: each and every component moves on its natural axes using one motor for each ax that is coded in such a way that the movement is smooth (the creator basically used the ball mouse technology). Every prosthetic is empty on the inside and that's where all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics" target="_blank">electronics</a> are placed.</p>
            
    <p>The electric part:
    this is pretty straight forward: every  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system" target="_blank"> electric impulse</a> from the brain is received by one thin wire, amplified and than (based on the value of it or on the combination of values) the part that is told to do something does its work (again, the whole process is very complicated and not interesting. it is a very long physics and biology lesson).</p>
            
        <p>The shortened lesson: neurons communicate via both electrical signals and chemical signals. The electrical signals are action potentials, which transmit the information from one neuron to the other. 
            An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier" target="_blank">amplifier/electronic amplifier</a> or amp is an electronic device that can increase the magnitude of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). It may increase the power significantly or its main effect may be to boost the voltage or current (power, voltage or current amplifier). It is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude" target="_blank">amplitude</a> of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a greater amplitude signal at its output. (whoa!....)

            <h1>PROJECT 1- BIONIC JAW</h1>
            <p>made by Lazar Matei</p> <br><br>
            <p>Besides the general part, the jaw is roughly 80% made out of aluminium. The other 20% part consists of a bone-like material so the body doesn't reject the prosthetic.</p>
            <img src="images/bionicjaw.jpg" alt="bionic jaw">
            <img src="images/lowerbionicjaw.jpg" alt="lower part of the bionic jaw">
            <p>It is represented by a single piece so it would be more resistant.

                In future versions, I plan to put touch and thermal senzors where the teeth would be placed in order to have a more natural feeling. To top this off, in the teeth-holes will be put a flexible material to imitate their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament">ligaments</a>.

            <h1>PROJECT 2- BIONIC ARM</h1> 
            <p>also made by Lazar Matei</p><br><br>
        <p>As I said in the introduction, every joint moves how it's supposed to. Each finger contains 3 moving parts which are the phalanges. The middle and the proximal one move according to what are they attached to and what is attached to them. The palm is flexible in order to <a href="https://www1.divxfilmeonline.net/the-mimic-2017/" target="_blank">mimic</a> the natural one.</p>

            <img src="images/weirdbionicarm.jpg" alt="weirder bionic arm">
        <p>For an easier accommodation for the brain, the hand will sense pressure and thermal changes using the same sensors mentioned in the jaw's description.</p>
